### 📝 Something to Say...
Born in a small town of China in 2001, I was given the name **Xinyu (心宇)**, which in Chinese means **holding the whole universe in one's heart**. True to my name, I have always been eager to explore the wonders of the world. My curiosity has led me to a wide range of interests, from playing instruments like the saxophone and violin to engaging in sports such as basketball, ping-pong, and badminton. I also have a deep fascination with philosophy and politics. My diverse interests inspire me to embrace the world as a life artist, continually exploring and creating.
