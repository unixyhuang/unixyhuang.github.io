### 👨🏻‍🎓 Biography
Welcome! My name is Xinyu Huang and I am currently working towards my Ph.D. degree at the [Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/comp/), concerning the related techniques of **Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT)**, under the supervision of [Dr. Yuanqing Zheng](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csyqzheng/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree at the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.en.uestc.edu.cn/), collaborating with [Prof. Yuanming Wu](https://faculty.uestc.edu.cn/wuyuanming/zh_CN/index/173473/list/index.htm) for around 2 years and have accomplished several journal papers on the topic of **IoT Security**.

### 📝 Something to Say...
Born in a small town of Jiangxi Province, China, in 2001, I was given the name Xinyu (心宇), which in Chinese means **holding the whole universe in one's heart**. True to my name, I have always been eager to explore the wonders of the world. My curiosity has led me to a wide range of interests, from playing instruments like the saxophone and violin to engaging in sports such as basketball, ping-pong, and badminton. I also have a deep fascination with philosophy and politics (but sometimes finding myself lost in countless thoughts...). My diverse interests inspire me to embrace the world as a life artist, continually exploring and creating. This passion for discovery is also the reason why I decided to pursue a PhD degree.
